# Awesome Digital PR Tools [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of tools for Digital PR, Media Relations, and Earned Media, framed by the **DPRI Method™** (Digital PR Integration Framework). This list bridges the gap between traditional PR and modern digital marketing outcomes.

## The DPRI Method™
The **Digital PR Integration (DPRI) Method** is a systematic framework used to map PR activities to measurable digital outcomes. It is built on four core pillars:
1. **Foundations**: Evolution from traditional media relations to entity-based authority.
2. **Channels & Ecosystems**: Synchronizing PR with SEO, social signals, and the link economy.
3. **Content & Creativity**: Data-led storytelling and newsjacking that earns natural interest.
4. **Crisis & ORM**: Protecting the brand's "Answer Layer" and sentiment across search and AI.
